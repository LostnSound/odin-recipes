        <p>These cupcakes are made from scratch with a stout beer, then filled with an Irish whiskey-chocolate filling and topped off with some Irish cream icing.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>⅔ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>⅔ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Irish whiskey, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>3 cups confectioners' sugar, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Irish cream liqueur (such as Baileys®), or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Bring Irish stout beer and 1 cup butter to a boil in a saucepan and set aside until butter has melted, stirring occasionally. Mix in cocoa powder until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Divide batter between the prepared cupcake cups, filling each cup about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs with sour cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low until well combined. Slowly beat in the beer mixture, then the flour mixture; beat until the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 17 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool the cupcakes completely. Cut cores out of the center of each cupcake with a sharp paring knife. Discard cores.</li>
            <li>Bring cream to a simmer in a saucepan over low heat; stir in bittersweet chocolate until melted.</li>
            <li>Mix in 2 tablespoons butter and Irish whiskey until butter is melted; let mixture cool to room temperature. Filling will thicken as it cools.</li>
            <li>Spoon the filling into the cored cupcakes.</li>
            <li>For frosting, whip 1/2 cup butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set mixer to low speed and slowly beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting is smooth and spreadable. Beat in the Irish cream liqueur; adjust thickness of frosting with more confectioners' sugar if needed.</li>
            <li>Spread frosting on filled cupcakes.</li>
        </ol>
